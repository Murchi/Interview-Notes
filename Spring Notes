Goals of spring :
    Lightweight development with java POJO
    Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling
    Declarative Programming with AOP
    minimize boilerplate java code
    
    
AOP(Aspect oriented Programming) :
    Add functionality to objects declaratively.
    Logging, security,transactions etc.
   
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) :
    Integration with Hibernate and JPA
    
    
 Primary Functions of spring container :
 Inversion of Control : create and manage object
 Inject object's dependencies (Dependency injection)
 
 Ways to configure Spring container :
 
 XML configuration
 Annotations
 Java source code.
 
 Spring Development Process :
 
 1. Configure Spring beans
 2. Create the spring container
 3.Retrieve beans from spring container
 
 ApplicationContext = spring container
 Spring bean = java object created by  Spring container
 
 Dependency injection : Constructor injection
 Setter injection : Injects dependency by calling setter methods in the class
 in setter injection when configuring the dependency in xml, tag property should contain the name of the setter method without "set" word 
 and converting the fisrt letter after "set" word to lowercase
 eg : setter method = "setDataprocessed" property name = "dataprocessed"
